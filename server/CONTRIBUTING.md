Installation steps to setup the project:

### 1. Install NPM or PNPM

Tips:

NVM makes this easy - make sure you install and use the latest LTS version.

### 2. Install postgres and create a database named "homeapp"

Example with brew:

```
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16
createdb homeapp
```
